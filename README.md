# Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

##  Objective
Learn and implement tree-based models for classification using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers. Analyze overfitting, feature importance, and model performance using cross-validation.

##  Dataset
**Heart Disease Dataset**

- Source: [Kaggle - Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)
- The dataset contains medical attributes like age, sex, cholesterol levels, etc., to predict the presence of heart disease.

---

##  Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Graphviz (optional for advanced visualization)

---

##  Tasks Performed
1. **Loaded the dataset** and explored data structure.
2. **Trained a Decision Tree Classifier** and visualized the tree.
3. Controlled **overfitting** using `max_depth`.
4. **Trained a Random Forest Classifier** and compared accuracy.
5. **Interpreted feature importance** using Random Forest.
6. **Evaluated models using cross-validation** and confusion matrix.
